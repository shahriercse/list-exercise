### Exercise List - (MERN Stack Project)

##### This is my first MERN stack project

#### This project is about listing your exercise list.

I started this project after learning MERN stack a bit. And this can be take as a reference project.

### Basic Features

      given their exercise name and duration of the exercise.
    - They can archive their exercise list, which is add on the archive page.
    - And also they can unarchive this list.
